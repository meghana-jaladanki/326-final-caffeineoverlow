## Innovative Idea: 
Caffeine Overflow is an on campus coffee ordering app, where members of the UMass Amherst community can order drinks or snacks for pickup from various cafes around campus. Creating a service like this will make it much more convenient for students to pick up their coffee or other items while on the go, instead of having to wait in lines. Our application does not relate to any other existing applications, since currently there is no service available similar to Caffeine Overflow. 

## User Interactions with Data:
We will manually input all of the drink options from each cafe and allow users to select the cafe that they would like to order from. Then, the menu for the selected cafe will be displayed and users can select the types of drinks that they want to order. They then will be able to add their drinks into a shopping cart and select checkout when they are ready. We will need to allow users to create an account so that they can place orders for pickup. They should also be able to enter their payment information such as a credit card or UCard when they are placing their order. We will also provide them with an option to pay in person.

## HTML & CSS Web Interface:

Login/Sign up Page:
This is our application’s login screen, where users also have the option to sign up if they do not have an account yet. Once users sign in, they can proceed to place their order. 

Menu Page:
This menu page will display the hours of the cafe and the drinks that are being sold. The user can then click on the drink that they would like to order and it will take them to the drinks option page. 

Drink Options Page:
Depending on the drink that the user orders, the options that they can customize will vary. In this example, the user ordered a Latte so they can specify the dairy, espresso shots, and sweetener that they would like for their drink. 

Payment Page:
After viewing their order details, users can fill in their payment details. Once the payment form is completed, users can click the “Place Order” button which will finalize their order and proceed to show them their order status. 

Status/Wait Time Page:
After filling in the details and completing the payment, users can view the live status of their order. They would be able to view all the items that they have purchased, and the respective time remaining for the order to be ready.
