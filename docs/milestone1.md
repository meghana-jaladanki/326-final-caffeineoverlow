## Innovative Idea: 
Caffeine Overflow is an on campus coffee ordering app, where members of the UMass Amherst community can order drinks or snacks for pickup from various cafes around campus. Creating a service like this will make it much more convenient for students to pick up their coffee or other items while on the go, instead of having to wait in lines. Our application does not relate to any other existing applications, since currently there is no service available similar to Caffeine Overflow. 

## User Interactions with Data:
We will manually input all of the drink options from each cafe and allow users to select the cafe that they would like to order from. Then, the menu for the selected cafe will be displayed and users can select the types of drinks that they want to order. They then will be able to add their drinks into a shopping cart and select checkout when they are ready. We will need to allow users to create an account so that they can place orders for pickup. They should also be able to enter their payment information such as a credit card or UCard when they are placing their order. We will also provide them with an option to pay in person.
